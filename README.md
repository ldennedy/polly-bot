# polly-bot

This project is a chatbot work in progress I'm writing in Python. It's a console input/output program, so nothing too complex.

It's called PollyBot because it responds to you by repeating things you've said to it, kind of like a parrot!

So far it works by remembering responses the user writes and attempts to generate some context for each input.
(Lists of split strings from the input.) Repeating responses/contexts are not added to the list of statements again.
(Hopefully to be a bit more efficient.)

This is still a WIP, because the decision-making for which responses to select from could be smarter.
It would be cool to develop a bot-chatting app from some of the concepts in this project.
